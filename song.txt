[Verse 1]
When I'm furthest from myself (Far away)
Feeling closer to the stars (Outer space)
I've been invaded by the dark (Can't escape)
Trying to recognize myself when I feel I've been replaced
When I'm furthest from myself (Far away)
Feeling closer to the stars (Outer space)
I've been invaded by the dark (Can't escape)
Trying to recognize myself when I feel I've been replaced

[Pre-Chorus]
I can feel a kick down in my soul
And it's pulling me back to Earth to let me know
I am not a slave, can't be contained
So pick me from the dark and pull me from the grave 'cause
[Chorus]
I still feel alive
When it is hopeless, I start to notice
And I still feel alive
Falling forward, back into orbit

[Verse 2]
So, when I lose my gravity in this sleepy womb
Drifting as I dream, I'll wake up soon
To realize the hand of life is reaching out
To rid me of my pride, I call allegiance to myself

[Pre-Chorus]
But I can feel a kick down in my soul
And it's pulling me back to Earth to let me know
I am not a slave, can't be contained
So pick me from the dark and pull me from the grave
'Cause

[Chorus]
I still feel alive
When it is hopeless, I start to notice
And I still feel alive
Falling forward, back into orbit
Oh, I still feel alive
It is hopeless, I start to notice
Oh, I still feel alive
Falling forward, back into orbit
[Pre-Bridge]
I can feel a kick down in my soul
And it's pulling me back to Earth to let me know
And this heart that beats inside of me will show
It will show

[Bridge]
Floating in outer space, have I misplaced a part of my soul?
Lost in the in-between, or so it seems, I'm out of control
Floating in outer space, have I misplaced a part of my soul?
Lost in the in-between, but it can't keep me asleep for long, 'cause

[Chorus]
I still feel alive (I can feel it)
When it is hopeless (It ain't hopeless)
I start to notice (Start to notice)
And I still feel alive (I can feel it)
Falling forward (Falling forward)
Back into orbit (Back into orbit)
Oh, I still feel alive (I can feel it)
When it is hopeless (It ain't hopeless)
I start to notice (Start to notice)
Oh, I still feel alive (I can feel it)
Falling forward (Falling forward)
Back into orbit (Yeah)
[Outro]
I still feel alive (I can feel it)
It ain't hopeless
I start to notice
I still feel alive (I can feel it)
Falling forward (Yeah)
I still feel alive
I still feel alive
